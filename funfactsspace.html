<P><b><strong>
1) Mercury and Venus are the only two planets in our Solar System that don't have moons.<br>
<br>
2) If a star passes too close to a black hole it can be torn apart.<br>
<br>
3) The hottest planet in our Solar System isnt Mercury but Venus.<br>
Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun Venus has a lot of <br>
gasses in its atmosphere. which cause the "GreenHouse Effect".<br>
<br>
4) Our Solar System is about 4.6 billion years old. Scientists estimate that it will<br>
another 5000 million years.<br>
<br>
5) Enceladus (one of Saturns moons) reflects 90% of sunlight which makes<br>
it more refelctive than snow.<br>
<br>
6) A light-year is the distance covered by light in a single year.<br>
<br>
7) The width of the Milly Way is around 100,000 light-years.<br>
<br>
8) The sun is about 300,000 times bigger than earth.<br>
<br>
9) Footprints and tiretracks left by astronauts on the moon wont disappear since <br>
there isnt any wind to blow them away.<br>
<br>
9) Because of gravity, a person who weighs 220 lbs (100kg) on Earth would only weigh<br>
84 lbs (38kg) on the surface of Mars.<br>
<br>
11) Scientists beleive there are 57 moons that orbit Jupiter, however only 53 of them<br>
have been named, also Jupiter has the most moons in our Galaxy<br>
<br>
12) The Sun makes a full rotation once every 25-36 days.<br>
<br>
13) Earth is the only planet not named after a god.<br>
<br>
14) The force of gravity can sometimes cause a comet to tear apart.<br>
<br>
15) It is thanks to our Sun and Moon that we have low and high tides.<br>
<br>
16) Pluto is smaller than the Earths moon, infact its smaller than the  <br>
United States.<br>
<br>
17) According to mathematics, white holes are possible, yet none have been found.<br>
<br>
18) Our moon is around 4.5 million years old.<br>
<br>
19) There are more volcanoes on Venus than any other planet within our Solar System.<br>
<br>
20) Uranus' blue glow is down to the methane in its atmosphere, which filters out all of the<br>
red light.<br>
<br>
21) The four planets in our Solar System that are know as gas giants, are Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn <br>
and Uranus.<br>
<br>
22) Uranus has 27 moons that have been discovered so far, 5 of them are large<br>
and the rest small.The biggest being Titania.<br>
<br>
23) Due to Uranus being tilted,its day takes 21 earth years.<br>
<br>
24) Triton, one of Neptunes moon, is gradually getting closer to Neptune.<br>
Scientists beleive that eventually Triton will get to close to Neptune,<br>
it will be torn apart by gravity and Neptune could end up with more rings<br>
than Saturn currently has.<br>
<br>
25) The only large moon to orbit in the opposite direction is Triton who orbits Neptune.<br>
<br>
26) The are more stars than grains of sand on every beach in the world.<br>
<br>
27) Neptune completes an orbit every 84 years.<br>
<br>
28) A day on Pluto lasts 6 days and 9 hours.<br>
<br>
29) Any free-moving liquid in outer Space will form itself into a sphere<br>
because of its surface tension.<br>
<br>
30) Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are all the inner Planets sice they are the closest to the sun.<br>
<br>
31) We know more about space than our own planet, mainly the deep oceans.<br>
Only about 5% has been explored and since our planet is roughly 75% water that leave another<br>
70% to be discovered.<br>
<br>
32) Light takes 8.3 minutes to travel from our Sun to Earth.<br>
<br>
33) If you were driving at 75 miles (121 km) per hour,<br>
 it would take 258 days to drive around one of Saturns rings.<br>
 <br>
 34) The Space Station circles Earth every 90 minutes.<br>
 <br>
 35) We always see the same side of the Moon no mater what side of the world we are on.<br>
 <br>
 36) There are three main types of galaxies,there is spiral, irregular and elliptical.<br>
 <br>
 37) In the northern skies, you are able to see to galaxies.They are Andromeda galaxy (m31)<br>
and the Triangulum galaxy(m33).<br>
<br>
38) In 2016 Scientists detected a radio signall from a source 5 billion light-years away,<br>
which means when the signal started its journey Earth didnt even exist.<br>
<br>
39) The closest galaxy to us it Andromeda, its estimated to be about 2.537 million light-years away.<br>
<br>
40) The Andromeda galaxy appears in the night sky as a smudge of light its als0 the furthest <br>
object in the night sky you can see with your eyes.<br>
<br>
41) The distance between the Sun and Earth,is defined as an Astronomical Unit (for short AU),<br>
<br>
42) The second man on the moon Buzz Aldrin. Moon was his mothers maiden name.<br>
<br>
43) The Mariner 10 is the only spcaecraft that has ever visited Mercury.<br>
It manuaged to take pictures of about 45% of the surface.<br>
<br>
44) If you shouted in space no one would hear you even if they are right next to you,<br>
<br>
45) Coca-Cola was the first drink to be consumed in space.<br>
<br>
46) Due to the lack of gravity astronauts can grow approximately two inches (5cm).<br>
<br>
47) The first women to travel to space was a Russian lady named Valentina Tereshkova.<br>
<br>
48) In spring 2011, the Hubble Space Telescope had traveled had over 115,000 trips around the globe.<br>

<br>
51) Although Saturn is the second largest planet, its the most lightest planet.<br>
<br>
52) Astronauts cant burp in space.The liquids and gasses in your stomach dont seperate<br>
in zero gravity.<br>
<br>
53) Its impossibe to whistle in a spacesuit.<br>
<br>
54) Uranus was originally named "George's Star".The name "Uranus" was  considered<br>
in 1782, but not official until 1850.<br>
<br>
55) A sunset on Mars is blue.<br>
<br>
56) Saturns density is low enough for a planet to float on water.<br>
<br>
57) The mass of the moon is about one-eightieth of Earths mass.<br>
<br>
58) The first ever mammal to go to space was a dog named Laika from Russia.<br>
<br>
59) Mercury has no atmosphere therefore there is no wind or weather.<br>
<br>
60) There is an estimated 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars in space.<br>
<br>
61) Red Dwarf stars that are low in mass can burn continually up to 10 trillion years.<br>
<br>
62) Jupiter is know as the dumping ground in our Solar System, since a large percentage of astroids <br>
are pulled in by Jupiters gravity.<br>
<br>
63) A day on Mercury is eqivalent to 58 earth days, and a year is equivalent to 88 earth days.<br>
<br>
64) Since space has no gravity normal pens wont work.<br>
<br>
