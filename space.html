    <h1><b>How Far Away Is The Universe?</b></h1>
    <p>The observable Universe is most likely to bigger than its thinking which is<br>
    about 46.5 billion light-years away and about 93  billion light-years in diameter.<br>
    </p><br>

    <h1><b>When looking into the night sky, you are looking back in time.</b></h1>
    <p>The stars we see in the night sky, arent actually there.<br>
       The stars are so far that the star light we see has taken such<br>
        a long time to travel across space to reach our eyes, which means<br>
         whenever we look out into the night sky and gaze at the stars<br>
          we are looking at what they used to look like.<br>
          For example the star Vega is relativly colse to us, abot 25 light-years away,<br>
          so the light we see today left the star 25 years ago.</p>

<h1><b><strong>There’s A Giant Cloud Of Alcohol In Sagittarius B2</strong></b></h1>
<p>Sagittarius B2 is a vast molecular cloud of gas and dust floating near the centre of the Milky Way,<br>
     26,000 light-years from Earth and, amazingly,<br>
      it contains 10-billion-billion-billion litres of alcohol.<br>
      The vinyl alcohol in the cloud is far from the most flavoursome tipple in the universe,<br>
       but it is an important organic molecule which can offer some clues<br>
       how the first building blocks of life-forming substances are produced.

<h1><b><strong>A Year On Venus Is Shorter Than Its Day</strong></b></h1>
<p>Venus is the slowest rotating planet in our Solar System.<br>
    Venus is so slow that it takes longer to fully rotate than<br>
    to complete its orbit, which means Venus has days last longer<br>
    than its years. Venus also home to one of the most inhospitable environments imaginable,<br>
     with constant electronic storms and it’s shrouded by clouds of sulfuric acid.

     <h1><b><strong>A Spoonful Of A Neutron Star Weighs About A Billion Ton</strong></b></h1>
     <p>Neutron stars spin incredibly quickly and are also incredibly dense.<br>
     It is estimated, if you could collect a tablespoon of matter from the centre of a neutron star,<br>
      it would weigh about one billion tons.</p>

      <h1><b><strong>It Is Estimated There Are 400 Billion Stars In Our Galaxy</strong></b></h1>
      <p>Our Sun is essential to us,its our source of light and energy<br>
        , but it is just one of the many, many stars that make up our galaxy, the Milky Way.<br>
         Current estimates suggest there are around 400 billion stars within the Milky Way.<br>

        <h1><b><strong>There Could Be 500 Million Planets Capable Of Supporting Life In Our Galaxy</strong></b></h1>
        <p>
                Scientists searching for extraterrestrial life focus on “Goldilocks Planets“.<br></br>
                These are planets which fall into a star’s habitable zone. Planet Earth<br>
                 seems to have exactly the right conditions for life to exist,<br>
                1) Its distance from the Sun means the temperature is right,<br>
                2) Water can exist as a liquid solid and a gas,<br>
                3) There are the right combination of chemical compounds available to build complex life forms.<br>
                 Other planets thought to have similar features are known as Goldilocks planets.<br>

                In the Milky Way alone there are estimated to be 500 million potential Goldilocks planets,<br>
                 so if life can exist in places other than Earth there is a huge number<br>
                  of potential planets. If these numbers are applied to all galaxies<br>
                 in the universe there could be a variety of planets capable of supporting life.<br>
                 Of course, there is no evidence life exists elsewhere.

        <h1><b><strong> It takes 225 Million Years For Our Sun To Travel Round The Galaxy</strong></b></h1>
        <p>Whilst the Earth and the other planets within our solar system orbit around the Sun,<br>
         the Sun itself is orbiting around the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way.<br>
         It takes the Sun 225 million years to perform a complete circuit of the galaxy.<br>
         The last time the Sun was in its current position in the galaxy the super-continent<br>
        Pangaea was just about starting to break apart and early dinosaurs were making an appearance.</p>

        <h1><b><strong>Our Solar System’s Biggest Mountain Is On Mars</strong></b></h1>
        <p>Olympus Mons on Mars is the tallest mountain on any of the planets in our Solar System.<br>
           The mountain is a gigantic shield volcano (similar to volcanoes in Haiiwai).<br>
         Standing at 26 kilometres tall and sprawling 600 kilometres across. To put this into scale,<br>
          this makes the mountain almost three times the height of Mount Everest.</p>

          <h1><b><strong> Uranus Spins On Its Side, With Some Sather Strange Results</strong></b></h1>
          <p>
         Most of the planets in the Solar System spin on an axis similar to the Sun’s,<br>
          slight tilts in a planet’s axis causes seasons as different parts become slightly closer<br>
         or further from the sun during their orbit. Uranus is an exceptional planet in many ways,<br>
          not least because it spins almost completely on its side in relation to the Sun.<br>
         This results in very long seasons.Each pole gets around 42 Earth years of continuous summer sunlight<br>
        followed by a wintry 42-year period of darkness. Uranus’s northern hemisphere enjoyed its last<br>
         summer solstice in 1944 and will see in the next winter solstice in 2028.

         <h1><b><strong>There Are Probably More Than 170 Billion Galaxies In The Observable Universe</strong></b></h1>
         <p>
                Different calculations provide different numbers for how many galaxies<br>
             there are in the observable universe.The observable universe is the part of the<br>
             universe we can see from Earth with our current technology.There maybe many more<br>
            galaxies but they are simply to far away for our telescopes to detect. Using data from<br>
             the Hubble Telescope astronomers have calculated there are likely to be around 170 billion<br>
             galaxies in the observable universe.

         <h1><b><strong>Voyager 1 Captured The Most Distant Photograph Of Earth</strong></b></h1>
         <p>In 1990, as part of the spacecraft’s ongoing mission, Voyager 1<br>
         turned its camera back on Earth and took a picture.<br>
         This became known as The Pale Blue Dot. Seen from 6 billion kilometres away,<br>
         the Earth appears as a tiny blue speck in the depths of space. Astronomer Carl Sagan,<br>
         who first suggested the idea of the photograph, noted, “From this distant vantage point,<br>
         the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it’s different.<br>
        Consider again that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us.”
