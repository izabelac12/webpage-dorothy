        <p class="paige-detail">Was a 15 year old gir,born on April 17,2000.
            living in Clydebank,Scotland.Paige lived with her mum Pamela Munro,
            her stepdad Andy Munro,and her younger sister and her 2 younger brothers.
            They were a happy little family with their arguments here and there like any ordinary family
            Paige adored her mum and her stepdad.Paige was an ordinary young girl, she was into makeup, fashion
            and loved to take selfies.Her mum describes her as a very respectful,very kind,very loving
            On Friday march 18 2016, Paige slept over at her friend Laurens house and would go to work the
            next mornig on a saturday.Paige had a part-time job as a hairdresser just to make a little
            bit of money whilst she was still in school.Since she started relatively early in the morning
            so she would buy her some food from a shop or a deli so that she could eat on the way if she
            hadn't had breakfats yet.

    <div class="b">
        <p>The next morning, Saturday march 19 2016, Paige set of for work.It got to around mid day and
            her boyfriend Dylan still hadn't got a text from Paige which was so out of character for Paige since she
            was always on her phone and on social media and paige was always really good at replying straight away,
            and she would never leave someone hanging on purpose.Dylan and Paige were on good terms, they hadn't
            had an argument.Since they were on good terms Dylan expected a goodmorning text or some type of text to
            just say that she got there ok.Because Paige was always on her phone it was very rare that she would forget
            her charger at home and let her phone completly run out of battery,and even if she did surely Laura
            or a co-worker could let her borrow it for a bit however still by lunch time Dylan hadn't gotten a text
            from her.Dylan realized very quickly that this wasn't normal for Paige, so her rang her work to ask
            if she was ok, however her boss answered and said that she never arrived to work that day.
            Immediately Dylan called Pamela to infrom her that Paige hadn't arrived at work that day and to
            see if Paige stayed at home or wasn't feeling well.Pamela obviousy knew that Paige hadn't texted
            her but as a mother she tried not to worry her self and think of logical reasons to why she hasn't
            texted her yet.With those logical reasons mixed with taking care of her other three children she
            didn't worry to much.Since Paige is 16 years old and was very street smart and Paige would take
            herself to and from work everyweek so Pamela wasn't to worried.After Dylan checked all of her
            social medias if she posted anything or liked something or commented on something though she hadn't
            posted that day which was very unlike Paige since she was always on her phone.Once they realized she
            wasn't on social media at all that day they decided to call the police.

        <p>The police arrived at Paiges home and they spoke to her mum and her stepdad meanwhile her
            friends and family were posting on FaceBook and other social medias just in case anyone
            saw her or was with her to tell her to contact her family but still by tea time. when it was
            getting dark outside, still she wasn't home, therefore a police and volunteer search team
            all went out to search the near by areas of Clydebank, this search rolled into sunday mornig
            however there was absolutely no sign of Paige.At this point it was realy worrying and people
            started to think the worst.

        So from the start the possibility or Paige running away wasruled out considering the
        fact that Paige was happy at home yet she could of been actingobviously this theory
        couldn't be rulled out completly since anything is possibleAlso the fact she wasn't in
        contact with anyone which is strange because most run awaycases won't cut of completely
        they will stil have some contact or they will often times than most stay with a friend
        espicially when there only 15 years old and dont have a full time job so if she did want
        to run away she probably would have to stay with a friend but every One but everyone Paige
        knew was talked to yet everyone said she wasnt staying with them.Very quickly Paiges friends
        and family started a specific FaceBook called hel find Paige and this page was just so that
        they can post her full name and her face to 1000 of people to see in just a few hours.Pamela
        posted pictures of everything that paige was wearing that day and the exact same route that
        Paige would of taken to work that morning also places frequently went just to try and give
        some information that could help someone recognise Paige.Friend, family and acquaintences
        from school were writing multipule messages a day.<br>
        <br>
        Pamela wrote :
        <q>I am totaly sick with worry and i just want my little girl home, she's not in trouble she's
            not in trouble she's just got to get home were she is safe and loved.</q>

    <div class="e">
        Volunteers and Paiges friends and family all made posters with Paiges name and face on.They
        were sticking them all over Clydebank where she lived and also all over the town where she
        worked, just in cases that she did get of the bus and got of there and something happened there.
        Meanwhile police decided to follow the route Paige would have taken that morningThe police know
        that she left her friends house on the saturday morning, they know that for a fact, they also
        know she didn't arrive at work so police were trying to figure out where in the that route she
        might of disappeared or even if she set of for that route at all.So they started of at Paiges
        friend Laurens house where she stayed the night before and where she would of set of to work the
        next mornig.They began walking to Paiges normal bus stop since Paige and Lauren lived quite close to
        each other it was almost the same route.By the bus stop there was 5 shops in a row, next to one another.
        So police went into everyone of these shops to speak to an employee or the manager to see if anyone saw
        Paige that morning </p>

      <p>The first shop the police went into they talked to the manager he said he had seen paige that morning 
        walking pass his shop into the deli a few shops down, around 8:15am he said " Paige walked right pass my
        shop i waved at her and she lifted her arm waving back she'd been in a week before and bought a roll but
        on Saturday she went to john Leathem  next door to get one". John owned a deli a few doors down called 
        the delicous deli.Ashiamed, the shopkeeper went on to say
